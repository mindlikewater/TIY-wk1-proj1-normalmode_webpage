# Introduction

This project is used to showcase a simple website that offers three different pricing tiers for digital services.  

# Objective

The goal of this project was to create a webpage from an image file.  I wrote the HTML and CSS files from scratch and then linked them to create the final visual website.  In this project, I practiced using:

- HTML tags
- CSS styling (manipulating padding, borders, colors, font styles, etc.)
- CSS positioning (relative and absolute)
- CSS layout (vertical-align and display: inline-block)

# Tools

Tools I used: Normalize CSS, Perfect Pixel, HTML, and CSS.
